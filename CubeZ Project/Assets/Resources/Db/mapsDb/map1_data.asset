  decription: The city was once part of the rail network in the UK, with about 10
    million passengers travelling each year. The city developed, new schools, gardens,
    and housing complexes were built. But now, when the epidemic of the virus has
    come from the city, only rubble remains, but the British army is trying to prevent
    looters from completely looting this city.
