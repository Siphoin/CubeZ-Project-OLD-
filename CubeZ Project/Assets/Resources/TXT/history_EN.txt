The year is 2060. Summer.

Another flu epidemic has begun, and in a very severe form.

The authorities of many countries began to develop new means of fighting the flu, but at first they were unsuccessful.

Finally, in September of the same year, a vaccine and drugs against the new flu stamp were developed.

85% of the world's population was vaccinated. The flu has receded.

In 2062, in the spring, there was an accident at the Three Anchors hydroelectric power station in China. But fortunately, most people were evacuated from the scene of the accident, but some were injured, and given that there was a nuclear power plant near the hydroelectric power station, they also received radioactive radiation.

In January 2063, the Chinese government decides to help the victims of that accident, namely, to save people from those mutations. Other governments have condemned this decision, as it contradicts the safety of people's lives.

In November 2064, China begins to produce the serum "AS-I-16", and a month later it is administered intravenously to all those affected, no side effects were detected.

A week after that, hospitals received strange complaints from people who had been injected with this syrovotka. Symptoms are as follows: Dizziness, fever, increased appetite.

Scientists could not understand the cause of such symptoms, later it became known that the symptoms began after people drank water from the tap, however, in others who were injected with serum and drank the same composition of water, this was not found.

Later it became known that after the accident at the hydroelectric power station, another accident occurred, followed by a small push at the nuclear power plant, respectively, the water was subject to contamination, but scientists did not claim that there could be such consequences. Realizing that there was a mistake in the development of the serum, the authorities began to prevent the news from publishing about those cases.

A month later, people who were injected with "AS-I-16", but who did not drink that water anymore, began to have serious mental disorders, and hunger only increased, there was also aggression, short temper, sweating, and a week later each of them died, and in their sleep.

The corpses were brought to the Allerbia laboratory in Hong Kong, for their autopsy and examination, an hour later something happened and communication with the staff was lost. The authorities realized that the situation smelled fried and cordoned off the entire city, calling to arms the entire guard of the country.

People did not understand what was happening and began to worry, but the authorities did not want to disclose this situation, strong unrest of citizens began.

After 2 hours, some kind of devilry began to occur, animated corpses of people began to take to the streets and show aggression to the army and ordinary people. Chaos ensued.

Later, a general of one of the units of the Chinese Guard was killed, telling the authorities on the radio one thing: "This is a zombie...".

The President of China resigned, fearing responsibility for the negligence of the actions carried out in relation to the serum and the work of the main laboratory of the country, but later, on a helicopter, where he successfully landed, a rocket was fired, and the helicopter fell to the ground, but the president survived, but when he got out of the fallen helicopter, he was finished off by one of the terrorists of the White Dagger organization, saying the phrase "Burn you in hell word, you dirty officials from above, do not even have the brains to properly manage important and risky operations, letting everything go. After that, he beat him to death with a bat, throwing his corpse to the dead.

Six months have passed. Many countries built huge walls from the territories where the infected were located, but unfortunately, many walls were broken through by hordes of hungry brainless corpses. Many cities were destroyed to the ground, now only zombies roam their streets, hungry for human flesh. And some countries were completely destroyed and disappeared.

The Allerbia laboratory was burned to the ground, and all the developments and sources of "AS-I-16" were also eliminated.

As it turned out later, after drinking the infected water, the defeated flu became active again in the body, it was in hibernation, and in combination with water, serum and flu, this led to the appearance of a zombie virus, later called "D-64".

Scientists around the world began to develop a vaccine against the virus, but as luck would have it, many laboratories were destroyed by armies of zombies, and research and developments were lost. But research is ongoing, but how long the development will take is not clear.

In the year after the pandemic, 75% of the world's population was destroyed. This is 5,872,843,920 people. There are 1 957 614 640 left.

Many of the survivors went to the forest, to villages and small towns, and most of the infected remained in the cities.

And you, whether you can survive in this harsh world...

Have a good game!
